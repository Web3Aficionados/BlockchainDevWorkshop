# BlockchainDevWorkshop

Here we introduce our newbie workshop participants to the concept of the blockchain.

But we decided to explain via the lens of a data analyst or data scientist. Here's why.

90% of tutorials on the internet today explains blockchain concepts first from the lens of a bitcoin miner, we believe this approach is too common, so we decided to find another angle.


## Big Data.

Imagine you right now, sitting inside the data center at Google, Amazon or Facebook.

Yes, that's a whole lot of data collected by these companies. And this helps explain the features of data and why they must be collected, aggregated, stored and analyzed.

A. Data Volume: These companies generated and collect terabytes of data every minutes.

B. Data Velocity: This considers the speed at which data is being generated by these companies. Every minute, there's someone posting a picture, or a tweet or a video.

C. Data variety: There's a myriad of data types being generated on the internet. Excel files, pictures, texts, images, geospatial data.

You might be thinking, what are we trying to do here?

It's simple.

We're trying to drum up a proble statement, so we can figure out how the blockchain solves this problem.
